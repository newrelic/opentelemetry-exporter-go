# New Relic Go OpenTelemetry Exporter [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic)

The `"github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic"` package
provides an exporter for sending OpenTelemetry data to New Relic.  Currently,
only traces are supported.

Example use:

```go
import (
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go/newrelic"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/global"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

func initTracer() {
	exporter, err := newrelic.NewExporter("My Service", os.Getenv("NEW_RELIC_API_KEY"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	tp, err := trace.NewProvider(trace.WithConfig(trace.Config{DefaultSampler: trace.AlwaysSample()}),
	        trace.WithSyncer(exporter))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	global.SetTraceProvider(tp)
}
```

## Disclaimer
This exporter is built with the alpha release of OpenTelemetry Go client. Due
to the rapid development of OpenTelemetry, this exporter does not guarantee
compatibility with future releases of the OpenTelemetry APIs.  Additionally,
this exporter may introduce changes that are not backwards compatible without a major
version increment.  We will strive to ensure backwards compatibility when a stable version
of the OpenTelemetry Go client is released.

The New Relic Go OpenTelemetry exporter also uses source code from third party
libraries. Full details on which libraries are used and the terms under which
